## About

> The wild oasis is an admin dashboard for an ideal hotel company that allows managers to create, update, and delete bookings, review checkins outs and unconfirmed bookings.
> On the dashboard the managers can see todays activities, summary of total sales, and also can perform checkin and checkout guests.
> I made this project by taking a complete react bootcamp `the ultimate react course`. and this is a main project of that bootcamp.

> it is live on [the wild oasis](https://the-wild-oasis-pro.vercel.app/)
